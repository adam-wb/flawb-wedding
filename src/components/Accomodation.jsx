                <h2>Swinton</h2>
                <p>We have secured exclusive use of the beautiful Swinton Park Hotel for the day of the reception, 
                    as a result it is possible to book a room at Swinton for the night of the 4th June through us should you wish.
                    Each room at Swinton will cost Â£150; this also includes breakfast the next morning.

                <a href={TRIP_ADVISOR_SEARCH}>TripAdvisor</a>
                <p>Alternatively, we reccommend one of a number of hotels around Masham and the surrounding area.
                    There are a few hotels in Masham itself, but accomodation in places like Bedale or Ripon would also give just a short drive to the venue.
                    You can find more accomodation that might not be on places like TripAdvisor on the <a href={VISIT_MASHAM_ACCOMODATION}>Visit Masham</a> site.

                <a href={AIRBNB_SEARCH}>AirBnB</a>
                <p>There are numerous AirBnB properties around Masham, often in very nice old houses.</p>
