There are a few hotels in Masham itself, but accomodation in places like Bedale or Ripon would also give just a short drive to the venue. You can find more accomodation that might not be on places like TripAdvisor on the Visit Masham site. There are also numerous AirBnB properties around Masham, often in very nice old houses. We've added some helpful links below to various websites for accomodation."
