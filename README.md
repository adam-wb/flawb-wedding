# Flawb Wedding

This is the source code for `https://flawb.co.uk`, the website I built to share info with the guests of our wedding.
Note the domain has since expired - you can still view the site at `https://flawb-wedding.web.app/`

# This repo

This is a static site created using Create React App, to run the site locally, run `npm i && npm run start`.
